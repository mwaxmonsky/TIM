/// @brief The horizontal computational domain and its decomposition
/// (Analogue of FMS mpp_domains, rebuilt on AMReX). A Domain owns the global
/// cell-centered index space, the connectivity flags, and the decomposition of
/// that index space into boxes assigned to MPI ranks (an amrex::BoxArray and an
/// amrex::DistributionMapping). Clients create distributed fields from
/// these products.
///
/// Design notes:
/// - The Domain owns index-space bookkeeping.
/// - The decomposition is horizontal-only by design: boxes are never split
///   in the vertical, and a field's k-extent is supplied at creation
///   (boxArray(nk)).
/// - By default the global domain is split into one box per rank. A
///   different box count can be requested for testing or finer-grained load
///   balancing.
/// - Halo widths are carried as metadata only. In AMReX, halos are a
///   per-field property (the ghost cells of a MultiFab), so the halo widths
///   stored here are consumed at field-creation sites rather than baked into
///   the domain's index space.
/// - A staggered field is not a clean tiling of its index space. Converting
///   the cell-centered decomposition to a face or node index type grows every
///   box by one plane per nodal direction, so the boxes on either side of an
///   internal boundary each hold a copy of the plane between them, and on a
///   periodic axis the plane at the far edge is the image of the one at the
///   near edge. This mirrors FMS symmetric memory, where neighboring PEs
///   likewise both hold a shared u/v/q edge. The contract for these shared
///   planes:
///   - Ownership follows AMReX's convention: the lowest-index box containing
///     a point owns it. That is the rule FabArray::OwnerMask, sum_unique,
///     and OverrideSync all apply, so a reduction that must count each point
///     once uses sum_unique (or masks with OwnerMask); a plain reduction
///     counts the stored copies.
///   - The copies are kept in agreement by computing shared planes
///     redundantly, from a rule both boxes evaluate identically (e.g.
///     analytically from global indices). Where redundant computation is not
///     possible, OverrideSync(periodicity()) reconciles them afterwards by
///     the same ownership rule.
///   FillBoundary fills ghost cells from valid ones and leaves disagreeing
///   valid copies alone, so agreement is the producer's obligation; halo
///   exchanges do not restore it.
/// - todo: this class is the intended producer of TIM::IoDecomp values
///   ("Decomp2D produced from AMReX distribution maps"); an io_decomp()
///   method will be added here once TIM's parallel IO layer merges. Its
///   initial precondition is the default one-box-per-rank decomposition
///   (IoDecomp describes one window per rank); supporting many boxes per
///   rank (GPU tiling, makeSFC/makeKnapSack load balancing) requires
///   generalizing the I/O DofMap generation to a list of windows per rank.
/// - todo: land-block elimination (the FMS mask_table analogue, e.g.
///   cesm_t232's masked 25x40 layout) is a planned Domain feature: drop
///   all-land boxes from the BoxArray before distribution. The I/O layer's
///   write-edge ownership is already mask-aware. This class would supply the
///   tile-liveness mask. At that point the tile layout is recorded at
///   decomposition time rather than derived from surviving box corners (the
///   constructor's derived-origin consistency checks assume an unmasked
///   grid).
